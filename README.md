# FilesComparison Version 1.0 29/02/2016

GENERAL USAGE NOTES
--------------------
The program allows to compare two .txt files. It shows unique strings and their numbers in both files (the string 
is considered to be unique if it has at least one difference with all strings in the second file).

Example of work
----------------
After compiling .cpp file the user should open a command line and enter the name of .exe file, the name of the first .txt file
and the name of the second one:
<.exe> <1.txt> <2.txt>
If it has been entered correctly, the program will show the following:
<1.txt> <number of the string> <"the string">
...
<2.txt> <number of the string> <"the string">
If program has not shown anything, there are not differences between these two files.
